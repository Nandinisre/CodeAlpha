# CodeAlpha 
I selected the CodeAlpha Online Internship. The internship task has been assigned, and I successfully completed all the tasks that were assigned to me. The tasks are:

*1) Hangman Game using Python*
Validation: You might want to add some input validation to ensure that the player enters a single letter each time they guess.

Feedback for Correct Guesses: Currently, the game only provides feedback for incorrect guesses. You could add a message when the player guesses a letter correctly.

Displaying Guessed Letters: It could be helpful to display the letters that the player has already guessed, so they don't waste attempts guessing the same letters again.

User-Friendly Experience: Consider adding more user-friendly messages and instructions to guide the player through the game.

*2) Simple ChatBot using Python*
   Importing random module: The random module is imported to allow the chatbot to randomly select responses.

Defining responses: A dictionary named responses is defined, where keys represent user inputs or messages, and values are lists of possible responses corresponding to each key.

chatbot() function: This function implements the chatbot logic. It starts by printing a welcome message and a prompt for the user to input a message. Then, it enters a loop where it continuously waits for user input. Inside the loop:

The user's input is converted to lowercase.
If the user input is "quit", the chatbot prints a goodbye message and exits the loop, ending the program.
If the user input matches a key in the responses dictionary, the chatbot selects a random response from the corresponding list of responses.
If the user input does not match any key, the chatbot selects a random response from the "default" list of responses.
Running the chatbot: The script checks if it is being run as the main program (if __name__ == "__main__":). If so, it calls the chatbot() function, starting the chatbot interaction.

This chatbot provides a basic conversational interface where users can interact by typing messages, and the bot responds with predefined replies. Users can exit the conversation by typing "quit".

*3) Task automation using Python*
   Importing necessary modules: The script imports YouTube class from the pytube library for fetching YouTube video metadata and tkinter for creating a simple GUI.

download_video(url, save_path) function: This function takes a YouTube video URL and a path to save the downloaded video. It tries to download the video with the highest resolution available in MP4 format. If successful, it prints a success message; otherwise, it prints the encountered exception.

open_file_dialog() function: This function opens a file dialog using filedialog.askdirectory() from tkinter, allowing the user to select a directory to save the downloaded video. If a folder is selected, it prints the selected folder path.

Main block:

It creates a hidden tkinter root window (root.withdraw()) to avoid displaying the main window.
Asks the user to input a YouTube URL.
Calls open_file_dialog() to let the user select a directory to save the video.
If a valid directory is selected, it initiates the download process by calling download_video() with the provided URL and save directory.
If no directory is selected, it prints "Invalid save location."
This script provides a basic way to download YouTube videos with a simple user interface for selecting the download location. However, keep in mind that downloading YouTube videos may infringe upon YouTube's terms of service, so ensure you have the necessary rights to download and use the videos.
